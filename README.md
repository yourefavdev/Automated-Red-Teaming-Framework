# web and ip exploit tool
This Python framework provides a suite of tools for offensive security operations, reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and more, all within an interactive command-line interface.

‚ú® Features
Reconnaissance: Perform DNS lookups and fetch HTTP headers.
Intelligence Gathering:
URL Analysis: Conduct WHOIS lookups for domains and perform basic page source analysis (scripts, external links, iframes, comments).
IP Address Analysis: Perform IP WHOIS lookups, IP geolocation (requires IPinfo API key), port scanning (requires Nmap), and OS fingerprinting (requires Nmap and privileges).
Exploit Arsenal:
CVE Search: Search for CVEs using the NVD database (requires NVD API key for higher rate limits).
Payload Generators: Generate simple XSS, SQLi, and command injection payloads.
Reverse Shell Generator: Create common reverse shell payloads for various languages/tools.
Offensive Operations:
Phishing Page Generator: Launch a simple, customizable phishing web server to capture credentials.
DNS Spoofing (Conceptual): Provides conceptual Scapy code for DNS response spoofing, emphasizing the need for a separate MitM setup.
Denial of Service (DoS) Tools: Includes basic SYN Flood, UDP Flood, and HTTP GET Flood capabilities (use with extreme caution).
Directory Scanner: Scan target URLs for common backend paths and custom wordlists.
API Spammer: Send multiple GET or POST requests to an API endpoint with customizable headers and data.
POST Requester: Send a single POST request with detailed response output.
Custom Payload Executor (Placeholder): Module awaiting implementation.
C2 Communication (Placeholder): Module awaiting implementation.
Interactive Interface: A rich, colored, and interactive command-line interface powered by rich.
